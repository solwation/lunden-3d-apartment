# CLAUDE.md — lunden-3d-apartment

Browser-based first-person 3D walkthrough of apartment **L1007, Kv. Lunden** (Peab), built from
the dimensioned floor plan `L1007_mattsatt_planritning.pdf`. The user writes in Swedish — reply
in Swedish. Code, comments and this file are in English; UI text is Swedish.

## Workflow rules

- **No branches, no PRs.** Commit and push directly to `main`.
- **Basic function first.** Work that isn't needed right now goes into a GitHub issue
  (`gh issue create`) instead of being done on the side. Keep issues small and concrete;
  reference the issue number in the commit that resolves it (`Fixes #N`).
- Verify changes in a real browser before pushing (see *Testing*). Don't claim something
  works from reading the code alone.
- Keep this file and `README.md` up to date when behaviour, structure or known facts change.

## Architecture

Static site, no build step, no npm. Runs as-is on GitHub Pages (relative paths only).

```
index.html             page shell, HUD, start overlay, import map (three from jsDelivr, pinned)
src/config.js          everything NOT in the PDF: heights, soffits, stair layout, colours
src/world.js           builds meshes + per-level collision segments from data/plan.json
src/stairs.js          stair treads + walking height function (stairHeight)
src/doors.js           SwingDoor / SlidingDoor (E to open/close, animated, dynamic collision)
src/player.js          WASD movement, circle-vs-segment collision, step-up, gravity
src/main.js            renderer, lights, pointer lock, door raycast prompt, loop
data/plan.json         GENERATED — do not edit by hand
tools/extract_plan.py  PDF → data/plan.json (stdlib only)
tools/walktest.html    headless movement test
```

### Geometry pipeline

The PDF is vector (ReportLab). `tools/extract_plan.py` decodes the page content streams and
classifies paths by colour/line width: wall polygons (dark fill), windows (white rects with
dark outline, full wall depth), glazed door frames (same but thin), door swings (grey arcs +
dark leaf line; dashed = Peab *tillval*), sliding doors (dashed grey line + arrow), fixed
cabinets (light fill, labelled by the text inside), sanitary fixtures, site (patio, hedge,
fences) and room labels. Scale comes from the 1 m segment of the scale bar on each page
(Entréplan is 1:55, Övre plan 1:50 — they differ).

Regenerate after changing the extractor: `python3 tools/extract_plan.py`

Plan coordinates (metres): **x = east**, **z = south** (z = 0 is the outer face of the
entrance/north façade, the patio is at z > 12.7). Three.js uses the same x/z with y up.
North = −z (the bedrooms Sovrum 1/3 face north).

### Known facts about the apartment (from the PDF + the user)

- Two levels, 5.75 × 12.70 m outside, 63 m² boarea. Row house; side walls are party walls.
- Ceiling height: **Entréplan ~3.0 m** (locally lower over Tvätt), **Övre plan ~2.8 m**.
- **Sovrum 1 and Sovrum 3 (north) have a lowered ceiling, ~2.4 m by the windows**, because an
  access balcony (*loftgång*) runs above. Modelled as a soffit in `SOFFITS`; its depth from the
  façade is a guess.
- U-shaped stair with winders at the east end: flight A (Entréplan, going east), 180° winders,
  flight B (going west) arriving in the upstairs hall. Upstairs slab opening = stair outline on
  Övre plan.
- Doors: Badrum and Klk on Entréplan swing into the passage by the stair, so all swing doors
  start closed. The dashed door to Allrum is an optional extra (tillval) and is not built.

Values marked *guess* in `src/config.js` (slab thickness, window sill/head, soffit depth,
cabinet heights) should be checked against Peab's material and corrected there — not by
hard-coding numbers elsewhere.

## Running locally

ES modules + `fetch` need HTTP (not `file://`):

```
python3 -m http.server 8137    # in the repo root → http://localhost:8137/
```

URL parameters (debugging / screenshots):

- `?at=x,z,yawDeg[,pitchDeg[,feetY]]` — place the camera. yaw 0 = north (−z), 90 = west,
  180 = south, −90 = east. `feetY` = 3.25 for Övre plan.
- `&shot` — hide the start overlay.
- `&clip=y` — clip everything above height y (cut-away plan view, e.g.
  `?shot&at=2.87,6.35,0,-90,16&clip=2.5` for Entréplan from above, `clip=5.6` + feet 19 for Övre plan).

## Testing

Headless Chrome with SwiftShader works on this machine:

```
# screenshot
google-chrome --headless=new --use-angle=swiftshader --enable-unsafe-swiftshader \
  --window-size=1280,800 --virtual-time-budget=8000 --screenshot=/path/out.png \
  "http://localhost:8137/?shot&at=1.0,11.8,-40,0"

# movement/collision/stair test — prints PASS/FAIL per route
google-chrome --headless=new --use-angle=swiftshader --enable-unsafe-swiftshader \
  --virtual-time-budget=60000 --dump-dom http://localhost:8137/tools/walktest.html
```

Run the walk test after any change to walls, doors, stairs or player movement. Take
screenshots into the session scratchpad, not the repo.

## Conventions

- Plain ES modules, no framework, no bundler. Keep three.js pinned in the import map.
- Target hardware includes a Surface Pro (Intel Iris 640): keep draw calls and lights modest,
  pixel ratio capped at 1.5, one shadow-casting light.
- New tunable numbers go in `src/config.js` with a comment saying where they come from.

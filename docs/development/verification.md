## Module and test map

```text
src/grill.js           the courtyard's kettle grill (GRILL, #204): E lights it — the lid swings open, flame sprites, glowing coals,
                       sparks, smoke, crackle + roar, a pool light (lights.extra); out by itself after burnSeconds; F keeps it
src/wallclock.js       analog kitchen clock (WALL_CLOCK) + the control strip: spool A D / ← →, pause
src/detail.js          DetailCuller (#189): far-away small meshes and things inside the flat hidden by its walls (seen from
                       outside) go to a layer the camera does not render; roots with `userData.moving` (our car, the cat,
                       darts, the basketball) are judged every update, not only when the camera moves (#267)
tools/lighttest.html   headless test: aim at every light switch / floor lamp, toggle it
tools/perfcount.html   draw calls / triangles at a few spots (compare before/after optimising)
tools/oventest.html    headless test: oven + microwave open/close (lamp inside), Moccamaster brews and clicks off
tools/thingtest.html   headless test: a wine bottle to the coffee table and back to the rack, a glass, F sends them home;
                       pour wine into a glass and drink it empty, whisky splashes into a tumbler, back in the BESTÅ = empty
tools/cuptest.html     headless test: an empty cup out without brewing, onto the worktop, brew, take the jug, pour, jug back,
                       carry the cup to the dining and coffee tables, a cup back into the cabinet; whisky in a cup of
                       coffee (#169): a splash, a warmer colour, never over full, drunk up as kaffekask
tools/grilltest.html   headless test: light the grill (flames, light, lid), F keeps it, put it out, it burns out by itself
tools/postertest.html  headless test: take the drawing (blank sheet stays), back on the desk, tape it up in the hall and on
                       the fridge door (swings with it), none on the kitchen window, reload → both back; look at one (panel, no walking,
                       ×/E close), Släng → ball lands and vanishes, out of storage; Ta ner → taped up elsewhere; lying in each lower bunk:
                       taped under the top bunk, facing down, can be looked at from there (`?shots`, `?panel`)
tools/boardtest.html   headless test: keep / throw away cat photos, a full board, the panel (needs a big virtual-time budget)
tools/detailtest.html  headless test: from the doorstep through the open front door the hall's doors are drawn (#210); inside
                       every Entréplan door is on a drawn layer, open or shut; outside the culler still works
tools/breaktest.html   headless test: the AK-47 breaks a glass on the dining table from 2 m and ~8 m (shards on the table, a wine
                       splash, more points far away), the timer mends it, a dart breaks a glass but not a bottle, the saber a
                       bottle, a held glass is not hit, none through a wall, a cup goes, F mends all (#263)
tools/curtaintest.html headless test (#342, #362): Sovrum 1's curtains open at the start, one stack each side (the west one by the west wall
                       and clear of the RÅGRUND chair, both off the glass, #403), E opens the sideways strip, no walking, ◀ draws both together
                       symmetrically until they meet in the middle and no further, D parts them, A at `speed`, scores once, the daylight cut, the teal glow, a reload
tools/blindtest.html   headless test: a blind in every window, folded at the start, dark upstairs / light downstairs; E opens the
                       mode (no walking), ▲ up to the head and no further, S down to folded, W at BLINDS.speed, the first pull
                       scores, the room's daylight cut (blackout > white), white glows, × / E close, the sash opens behind it,
                       the state survives a reload
tools/clocktest.html   headless test of the wall clock (?time=7, spool, pause, sun height by month)
```

## Testing

Headless Chrome with SwiftShader works on this machine:

```
# screenshot
google-chrome --headless=new --use-angle=swiftshader --enable-unsafe-swiftshader \
  --window-size=1280,800 --virtual-time-budget=8000 --screenshot=/path/out.png \
  "http://localhost:8137/?shot&at=1.0,11.8,-40,0"

# movement/collision/stair test — prints PASS/FAIL per route
google-chrome --headless=new --use-angle=swiftshader --enable-unsafe-swiftshader \
  --virtual-time-budget=60000 --dump-dom http://localhost:8137/tools/walktest.html

# touch input (joystick + look + start button) — prints PASS/FAIL
google-chrome --headless=new --use-angle=swiftshader --enable-unsafe-swiftshader \
  --virtual-time-budget=30000 --dump-dom http://localhost:8137/tools/touchtest.html
```

In a cloud session (no `google-chrome`, cdn.jsdelivr.net blocked): `python3 tools/devserve.py [port] [root]` serves
the checkout with three.js from the npm tarball (cached in ~/.cache), and Chrome is Playwright's
the installed Playwright Chromium (for example `~/.cache/ms-playwright/chromium-*/chrome-linux64/chrome --no-sandbox`; some environments provide `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium`). Such a VM has ~4 CPUs: run at most ~3 headless test
runs (agents) at a time, more only slows every one down. `/orkester [område]` (.claude/commands/orkester.md) runs a
session as an orchestrator that works through the open issues with subagents under these rules.
Several orchestrators (separate VMs) sync through issue #420 (label `orkester`, kept off the fridge notes): each keeps
one status comment there and reserves whole chains with `in-progress` + a comment on each issue.

`python3 -m http.server` sends no Cache-Control, so a headless Chrome reusing a profile may serve an *old* copy of a
module that hasn't changed for a while (heuristic caching) — give each run a fresh `--user-data-dir=$(mktemp -d)`.

To test the update notice locally: `tools/stamp.sh /tmp/site abc1234`, edit
`/tmp/site/version.json` to another version **and another `content` hash** (only a changed hash reloads, #304),
serve `/tmp/site` and load it.

Run the walk test after any change to walls, doors, stairs or player movement, and the touch
test after input changes. Headless SwiftShader renders only a few frames per second, so tests
drive `window.__app.step(dt)` / `Player.update` directly instead of waiting on frames. Take
screenshots into the session scratchpad, not the repo.

**Scope the tests to what the change can reasonably affect** (the user: save time and tokens, don't run the whole
suite every time):
- the test(s) for the feature you touched, plus a new or extended test for new behaviour;
- every test that refers to what you moved or renamed: `rg -l` tools/*.html for the config key, builder, module or
  the old coordinates (e.g. moving the Sovrum 1 bed must run tvtest, which aims at the bed's TV);
- walktest / stucktest only when walls, doors, collision, furniture footprints, terrain or player movement changed;
  touchtest only for input changes; perfcount only for geometry that adds meshes / materials.
- Not the whole list "to be safe"; a pre-existing failure you happen to see goes into an issue, not into your change.
